Aura Glow Co
ABOUT 
Aura Glow Co. was born from Joelle’s personal skin journey. After battling acne, dark spots, and hyperpigmentation — and trying countless big-name products that only made things worse — she knew there had to be a better way.
Tired of harsh chemicals and fake promises, Joelle started creating skincare for people like her: simple, gentle, and effective. No frills, no fuss — just the right balance to help your natural beauty shine through.
Simplicity isn’t plain and beauty that doesn’t beg for attention
1. Mission and Vision Statements & Target Audience
Aura Glow Co. caters to young women aged 18 to 35 who appreciate minimalist beauty, gentle skincare, and a touch of elegance. These women are often students, young professionals, and creatives who are looking for trustworthy skincare that fits seamlessly into their routine.
They value authenticity over perfection, prefer quality over quantity, and enjoy brands with personality and purpose. Many are tired of harsh chemicals and overwhelming 10-step routines, seeking instead natural products that are kind to the skin—and the soul. 
Slogan: Skincare that whispers, not shouts.
