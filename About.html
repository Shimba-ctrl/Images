      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>Aura Glow Co  was born from Joelle’s personal skin journey. After battling acne, dark spots, and hyperpigmentation — and trying countless big-name products that only made things worse — she knew there had to be a better way.

        Tired of harsh chemicals and empty promises, Joelle began creating skincare for women like her: products that are pure in ingredients, powerful in results, and personal in care.
        
        Aura Glow Co  is more than skincare. It’s a philosophy — proof that simplicity can be luxurious, and that beauty shines brightest when it’s real</p>
